# Surface Crack Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting surface cracks in structural images using deep learning techniques.
The system accurately identifies and highlights cracks to support structural health monitoring.

## Project Overview
Surface crack detection is an important task in civil engineering to ensure the safety of buildings,
roads, and bridges. This project uses a deep learning–based segmentation approach to automatically
detect cracks from images.

## Features
- Detects surface cracks from input images
- Highlights crack regions for easy visualization
- Reduces manual inspection effort
- Supports early detection of structural damage

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- U-Net Architecture
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras

## Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of crack and non-crack surface images.
Images are preprocessed and resized before training.

## Methodology
1. Image preprocessing and normalization  
2. Training a U-Net based segmentation model  
3. Predicting crack regions on test images  
4. Visualizing detected cracks on surfaces  

## Results
The model successfully detects surface cracks with good accuracy and highlights damaged regions,
making it useful for real-world structural inspection applications.

## Applications
- Building safety inspection
- Road and bridge monitoring
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Smart city projects

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of deep learning for automated surface crack detection.
It can be further enhanced by using larger datasets and advanced architectures.
